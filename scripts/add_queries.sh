# Query insertion script.
#
# Takes one required argument: the project name
# That json file must contain all of the following
#
# name         name for project, usually the name of the software (binutils-2.25, openssh-2.1, etc)
# directory    directory in which src-2-src query injection will occur -- should be somewhere on the nas
# tarfile      path to software tar file
# configure    how to configure the software (./configure plus arguments) (will just use /bin/true if not present)
# make         how to make the software (make might have args or might have FOO=bar required precursors)
# install      how to install the software (note that configure will be run with --prefix ...lava-install)
#
# script proceeds to untar the software, run btrace on it to extract a compile_commands.json file,
# which contains all information needed to compile every file in the project.
# then, the script runs lavaTool using that compile_commands.json file, on every source file,
# adding extra source code to perform taint queries.  At the time of this writing, the taint
# queries were for every argument of every fn call, injected both before and after the call.
# Also, the return value of the fn is queried.  Oh, and lavaTool also injects "queries" that
# indicate when a potential attack point has been encountered.  At the time of this writing,
# that includes calls to memcpy and malloc.
#
# After lavaTool has transformed this source, it exits.  You should now try to make the project
# and deal with any complaints (often src-to-src breaks the code a little). Once you have a working
# version of the compiled exec with queries you will need to log on to a 64-bit machine
# and run the bug_mining.py script (which uses PANDA to trace taint).
