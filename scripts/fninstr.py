"""

Second analysis.

Determine which functions we will instrument. This is a little more
complicated than determining which are internal functions for which
we have bodies and which are not. When we say we will instrument a
function we mean both of the following.

  * Adding lava queries to body (that could later find DUAs or ATPs
    under taint analysis).
  * If we are using data flow, then it also means adding data_flow
    first arg to defn, prototype, and all calls

When do we instrument a function 'foo'?

1. Obviously, only if 'foo' has an implmentation (body) can it be
   a candidate to be instrumented in the first place.

2. Say a function 'foo' is a candidate for instrumentation. But
   'foo' is passed, as a paramenter, to another function, 'bar'.
   If 'bar' is not a candidate for instrumention then neither can
   'foo' be since calls to 'foo' from bar can't be instrumented.
   Note that resolving this sort of relation requires recursing.

3. If a function's body isnt instrumented then calls to that function
   cannot be instrumnted with data_flow arg.

4. Probably we can safely ignore 'extern' since it is often, oddly,
   applied to functions for which we observe a body.
